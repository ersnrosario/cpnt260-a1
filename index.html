      Full Life Program. What's It All About?
   </h2>
   <p>
      The best place to start for betterment is the individual because it’s where one has the most control. It doesn’t make sense to think of society first, then put ourselves after. <em>We cannot offer society any goods when we’re miserable</em>.  
      However, individual wellbeing isn’t all about personal desire. There are things conducive to our wellbeing in a way that aren’t purely subjective. Almost all of us would agree that nourishment is better than starvation, friendship is better than loneliness, and so on. These are fulfilling experiences that most can agree increase individual wellbeing.  
      Because individual wellbeing correlates with fulfilling experiences, we need to define fulfilling experiences as tangible methods that we can apply in real life. It’s much better to have firm guidelines than a non-directed outlook on life. <strong>This is what the FULL life program is about</strong>.
